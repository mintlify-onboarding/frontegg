These integrations are designed to simplify the process of incorporating these services into your workflows. The step-by-step instructions provided for each integration make it easy to set up and customize your connections.

For cases where a desired platform is not available as a preset integration, we offer the possibility of using custom webhooks. This approach enables you to configure your own webhook connections, ensuring that even unique integration needs are met.

#### Webhooks

Webhooks serve as bridges between applications, enabling real-time communication and action-triggering. In essence, a webhook is an HTTP callback that allows one application to send data to another application automatically when a specific event occurs. It eliminates the need for constant polling of data by enabling systems to be notified when relevant events happen. Learn more about how to subscribe to [Webhooks](/docs/webhooks) in Frontegg.
