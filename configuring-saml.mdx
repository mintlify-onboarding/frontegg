Follow the instructions below to learn how to configure SSO for the SAML 2.0 standard.

> Configuring Custom Domains Before SAML Configuration

> We highly recommend using Custom Domains to avoid third party cookie-issues and this recommendation is appies to both _Embedded_ and _Hosted_ login customers. Since it is very cumbersome to switch to a custom domain after you've gone live - and especially if you have active SSO connections - we encourage you to configure custom domains in your Production environment from the get-go. Learn more about [Custom Domains](/docs/custom-domains).

#### Configuring SAML in Your Frontegg Portal

Go to **Environments âžœ \[NAME OF ENVIRONMENT\] âžœ Authentication âžœ SSO**.

To configure SAML, you need to do the following: 

##### Add your ACS URL

The _ACS URL_ will contain your domain followed by `/auth/saml/callback`. We strongly encourage you to configure a [custom domain](/docs/adding-custom-domain) in your Frontegg app before configuring your SAML connection, as it may require downtime to change it retroactively _after_ configuring your SAML connection. Custom Domains are beneficial for a number of reasons, such as avoiding cookie issues and enhancing your brand. Learn more about [Custom Domains](/docs/custom-domains).

If you opt **not** to configure a custom domain, use your `frontegg subdomain` followed by `/auth/saml/callback` for your ACS URL. 

##### Add the SP Entity ID

Customers use this value when they configure their identity provider. We recommend you use the name of your application for this field.

##### Add a Redirect URL

If you are using the **Hosted login** method, the Redirect URL should be **https://\[your-frontegg-domain\].frontegg.com/oauth/account/saml/callback.**

If you are using the **Embedded Login** method, the Redirect URL should be \[your-application-url\]/account/saml/callback, for example: **http://localhost:3000/account/saml/callback**.

### Allow your customers to apply the connection or apply it for them

After configuring SAML in the Frontegg Portal, you can allow your end users either to apply the SSO connection via the Self-service or apply the connection details from their IDP on their behalf, via the Backoffice âžœ Accounts âžœ Account âžœ Actions SSO âžœ Configurations. 

##### Enable SSO Tab in the Admin portal

For enabling the SSO tab in the Self-Service for your end users:

> ### ðŸš§
> 
> Admin portal integration
> 
> Make sure that you have integrated the Admin portal into your application as described in (doc:react-self-service).

After the SSO tab is enabled, your customers can follow the instructions for adding the details of the connection from the IDP - [here](/docs/saml-idp-instructions). 

##### Apply the connection from the Environment Backoffice

For applying the SSO connection on behalf of your customers, you can use the Backoffice or do it by using our [APIs](/reference/ssoconfigurationcontrollerv1%5Fcreatessoconfiguration).
