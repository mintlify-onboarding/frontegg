### Capabilities

However you want your users to sign up and log in, you'll find authentication methods that meet your needs. You could keep it old-school with email and password, or use passwordless for a more modern approach. You could offer social login for quick access, or SSO for your more serious customers. But you don't have to choose. Add a number of authentication methods and let your users choose for themselves.

#### Passwords and Passwordless Authentication

Password and passwordless authentication are the most common ways to authenticate users. Password authentication is a traditional method that requires users to enter a username and password combination to gain access to their account. Passwordless authentication, on the other hand, enables users to log in without a password, using methods such as biometric authentication, one-time codes, or magic links. Our platform supports both password and passwordless authentication, providing a flexible and secure way to authenticate your users.

#### Passkeys Authentication

A passkey is a cryptographic key that is unique to each user and can be used to authenticate them. Passkeys are a quick but secure way for users to authenticate without requiring them to remember a password or use an external authentication provider.

#### Social Login Authentication

Social login lets users log in with apps they already use, in just one or two clicks. This feature simplifies the login process for users, eliminating the need for them to create and remember a new set of credentials. Our platform supports social login with Google, Facebook, Github, Microsoft, Slack, Apple, and Linkedin, allowing your users to authenticate themselves using their preferred social media account easily.

#### Single Sign-On (SSO)

Single sign-on (SSO) enables users to log in once and gain access to multiple applications, eliminating the need for them to enter their credentials repeatedly. Frontegg supports SSO using industry-standard protocols such as OpenID Connect (OIDC) and Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), giving your customers an easy way to add your app to their SSO-supported apps.

#### User Impersonation

Frontegg goes beyond your users logging in as themselves. Sometimes you need to log in as your users. Frontegg supports that too. This capability lets you log in as a user to troubleshoot issues or perform tasks on their behalf. Frontegg supports impersonation, providing a convenient way for administrators to perform their duties without requiring users to share their credentials.

Whether you're building a new application from scratch or looking to improve the security of an existing application, our authentication platform provides a flexible, scalable solution that can be customized to meet your specific needs. We're committed to delivering a secure, reliable authentication service that helps you build better, more secure applications.

#### Machine-to-Machine (M2M) Authentication

Not everyone logging into your app will be human. You may also have machines authenticating on your platform. Frontegg supports that too. Learn more about [Machine-to-machine Authentication](/docs/machine-to-machine-authentication) in Frontegg.
