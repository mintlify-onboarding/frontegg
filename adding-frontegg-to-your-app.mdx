### Getting Started with Frontegg

Welcome to Frontegg, your gateway to seamless user management, enhanced security, and exceptional user experience! This onboarding toolkit provides an easy step-by-step map that you can use as a reference throughout your integration process— from the initial integration of our platform into your application to implementing its powerful features.

After [signing up ](https://portal.frontegg.com/) and creating a Frontegg account, get your app up-and-running with the following quick-steps: 

* Customize your Login Box styles and visual elements.
* Enable authentication methods, token creation ability and more in your [Login Box](/docs/login-box-overview)
* Adjust and manage the settings you toggled on (in the previous step) via your [Admin Portal](/docs/admin-portal-introduction)
* [Integrate Frontegg](/docs/login-box-builder) with your Development environment. Optionally integrate your [Admin Portal](/docs/admin-portal-builder) as well.
* Go to your Development environment and customize features (e.g., create roles and user entitlements; subscribe to [Webhooks](/docs/webhooks-1), [Prehooks](/docs/prehooks), and more).
* Add another environment (i.e., Staging/QA) and publish your Login Box and Admin Portal settings from the builder (note that builder-settings will be copied automatically while other settings your devise in the portal will need to be manually copied via [Frontegg's APIs](/reference/getting-started-with-frontegg-apis)).
* Add a _Production_ environment (similarly to the previous step, some settings will need to be transferred manually)
* Create [Custom Domain(s)](/docs/custom-domains) to minimize cookie issues and avoid the hassle of changing it afterwards **(this is optional but highly recommended)**.

#### Integrate with Frontegg

Start by configuring your Login Box. The Login Box is what your customers use to log in to your application. You can configure how it looks and how it works.

#### Customize Styles and Visual Elements

Tailor the Login Box to your brand so that it fits seamlessly into your application; You can choose your brand's color scheme and logo so the login box reflects your brand guidelines.

After integrating and testing your Login Box, proceed to your [Admin Portal Integration](/docs/admin-portal-builder).

### Admin Portal Integration

After [Integrating your Login Box](/docs/login-box-builder) with your application, it's time to add your [Admin Portal](/docs/admin-portal-builder). Follow its step-by-step instructions for easy setup. After adding the Admin Portal to your application, go to your portal's [admin section](https://portal.frontegg.com/), configure settings, and grant access to users based on their roles and permissions.

After integration is complete, users can access their profile information as well as various role-based features directly from your application.
