### Adding Custom Domains

To avoid frustrating cookie issues and to enhance your branding, we encourage you to use a custom domain.

By default, you have a Frontegg Domain, which ends with   **.frontegg.com**. By using this Frontegg Domain, however, you may encounter unwanted cookie issues and use a domain that is not consistent with your brand. 

### Why Use a Custom Domain?

#### Avoid Cookie Issues

Some browsers block third-party cookies by default. Providing a custom domain as your application UI domain will give you the ability to support these browsers.

#### Enhance Your Brand

Instead of seeing .frontegg.com in your domain, you might prefer to have your customers see your custom domain. For instance, when your customers use your application to login, your application might direct them to the following URL:  
  
HTTP

`https://your-application.frontegg.com/oauth/account/login
`

Rather than see a domain with .frontegg.com in it, you might prefer that your customer see **your** domain instead.

Read below to learn how to configure a custom domain.

### Configuring Custom Domains

To configure custom domains, your Frontegg portal, go to **Environments ➜ \[NAME OF ENVIRONMENT\] ➜ Env Settings ➜ Domains**.

> ### 📘
> 
> Use Subdomain as Custom Domain
> 
> A common practice is to use a subdomains as the custom domain because if your app is hosted on app.sample.com and you have an existing A Record for that domain, you cannot use app.sample.com as a custom domain on Frontegg. Instead, use a subdomain as the custom domain, like auth.sample.com.

After adding the CNAME to your DNS configuration, click the _Verify_ button. If Frontegg is able to verify the CNAME record, you will see a success message. After a successful setup, you should also see your custom domain listed on the Administration Page's Domain tab with a _verified_ tag.
