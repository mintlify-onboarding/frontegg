title: "Validate JWT Token with Public Key"
---

If you choose not to work with any of the Frontegg middlewares, you can as easily validate your JWT token using the `Frontegg public key` available from the Frontegg Portal.

## Step-By-Step Guide

Follow the steps below to use the public key from the JWT token signature to verify a JWT token:

### Step 1: Get Public Key

Go to **Environments âžœ \[NAME OF ENVIRONMENT\] âžœ Authentication âžœ JWT**.

Copy the public key for the JWT signature.

### Step 2: Validate Token

You can now verify the token using the public key. Use the code sample below to validate the JWT and get the user's information from the token.  
  
Node.JSPython

`const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

const cert = 'PUBLIC_KEY_FROM_FRONTEGG_PORTAL';
jwt.verify(token, cert, function(err, user) {
  console.log(user) // user info from the token
});
`

`import jwt

jwt.decode(token, "PUBLIC_KEY_FROM_MANAGEMENT_PORTAL", algorithms=["RS256"])
`

After validating the user, you get a user object containing information about the user.
