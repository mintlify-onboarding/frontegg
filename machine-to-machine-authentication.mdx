You can enable authentication with other sources (such as CLI tools) and allow your customers to log in via those CLI tools and manage their API tokens via the Admin Portal. We support User (Personal) Tokens and Tenant (API) Tokens. Read on to learn more. 

## Types of API tokens

Frontegg supports token generation for Personal (User) and Tenant (API) Tokens. 

You can generate _two types_ of tokens for Tenants and Users â€” **Access Tokens** and **Client Credential** token types.

> Access Tokens and Client Credentials
> 
> **IMPORTANT**\- When using **Access tokens** you need to pass the access token in the X-API-KEY header. When using **Client Credentials** M2M token type, you should pass the generated bearer in the Authorization header.

### User (personal) tokens

User tokens are tied to the user and will always contain the user context and the roles/permissions of the user on the active tenant.

User token will be **deleted** once the user is deleted from the system.

#### Creating personal tokens

Creating personal tokens is possible using 2 methods: 

* Via the admin portal (for the end-user)
* Via API call

##### Creating personal tokens via the Admin Portal

After embedding the [Admin Portal Integration](/docs/admin-portal-integration), allow your users to generate tokens for themselves by following [API Tokens](/docs/admin-portal-api-tokens) guide. The type of the token that will be created is defined, by what is chosen under [M2M Tokens](/docs/m2m-tokens).

##### Creating personal tokens via API

Want to experiment API tokens before allowing your users with the self-service experience they deserve? No worries - we got you covered!

Generating API token via API is easy as 1,2,3:

###### Authenticate your environment

**Environments âžœ \[NAME OF ENVIRONMENT\] âžœ Settings âžœ General Settings**

cURL

`curl --location --request POST 'https://api.frontegg.com/auth/vendor' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "clientId": "[your-workspace-client-id]",
    "secret": "[your-workspace-secret]"
}'
`

###### Create user token

Using the access token from the `/auth/vendor` create the user API token. You will need to pass:

* `frontegg-user-id` header - To represent the user ID which the token will be created for
* `frontegg-tenant-id` header - To represent the tenant ID which for the context of the user
* `description` \- to represent logical description which will help you and the user remember what this token is for

cURL

`// Client credentials
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.frontegg.com/identity/resources/users/api-tokens/v1' \
--header 'frontegg-user-id: acme-user-id' \
--header 'frontegg-tenant-id: acme-id' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer [token-from-vendor-authentication]' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "description": "Token for CLI calls"
}'

// Access Token 

curl --location --request POST 'https://api.frontegg.com/identity/resources/users/access-tokens/v1' \
--header 'frontegg-user-id: acme-user-id' \
--header 'frontegg-tenant-id: acme-id' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer [token-from-vendor-authentication]' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "description": "Token for CLI calls",
    "expiresInMinutes": 60
}'
`

This API will return `clientId` and `secret` which will be used for the actual JWT exchange or the Access token, depending on the type of the token.

> Shhhhh... It's a secret...

> Secrets are shown clear only once on the API tokens creation. You know why? Because they are saved hashed and bcrypted and CANNOT be reversed.

**You are good to go to [Authenticate your API!](#authenticate-your-api-token)**

### Tenant tokens

Tenant tokens are tied to the tenant and don't have any notion of user on them. The roles/permissions on the API tokens match the scopes given to the token when it was created.

#### Creating tenant tokens

Creating tenant tokens is possible using 2 methods: 

* Via the admin portal (for users with required permissions)
* Via API call

##### Creating tenant tokens via the Admin Portal

After embedding the [Admin Portal](/docs/admin-portal-integration), allow your account admins to generate tokens by themselves as specified in the [API Tokens ](/docs/admin-portal-api-tokens) guide. The type of the token created is defined by the [Access Token](/docs/time-bound-token-expiration) type.

`

###### Create tenant token

Using the access token from the `/auth/vendor` create the user API token. You will need to pass:

* `frontegg-tenant-id` header - To represent the tenant ID which the token is created for
* `description` \- to represent logical description which will help you and the user remember what this token is for
* `roleIds` \- ids to represent the roles which the token will be created for
* `metadata` (optional) - JSON which can include additional metadata for the token

##### Get roles for access tokens

> Extracting Roles from Access Tokens
> 
> Access Tokens are permanent and therefore, do not contain roles. 
> 
> If you use Frontegg Backend SDKs, please check the required versions that already support this functionality on the [API tokens](/docs/admin-portal-api-tokens) guide, 
> 
> If you use Frontegg Roles & Permissions but do not use our backend SDKs you should access the roles of that token by following the steps below:
> 
> * Get the access token from Frontegg.
> * Verify it with your environment public key.
> 1. Use the `sub` from the token - this is the {:id} and send a request to  
> `https://api.frontegg.com/identity/resources/vendor-only/users/access-tokens/v1/:id` or `https://api.frontegg.com/identity/resources/vendor-only/tenants/access-tokens/v1/:id`
> 
> We recommend caching these responses on your end.
> 
> If you donâ€™t use Frontegg Roles & Permissions you should make a request to either `https://api.frontegg.com/identity/resources/vendor-only/users/access-tokens/v1/active` or `https://api.frontegg.com/identity/resources/vendor-only/tenants/access-tokens/v1/active` to verify that that token is still valid.

`// Get all Access Tokens for a tenant with Roles IDs:

curl --location 'https://api.frontegg.com/frontegg/identity/resources/tenants/access-tokens/v1' \
--header 'frontegg-tenant-id: acme-id' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer [token-from-vendor-authentication]'

// Get all roles and permissions for an access token by id:

curl --location 'https://api.frontegg.com/identity/resources/vendor-only/tenants/access-tokens/v1/:id]' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer [token-from-vendor-authentication]'

### Authenticate your API token

Using the `clientId` and `secret` from the token creation step, you can now exchange your token to a perfectly signed JWT.

cURL

`curl --location --request POST 'https://[your-frontegg-workspace-url]/identity/resources/auth/v1/api-token' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "clientId": "[the-api-token-client-id]",
    "secret": "[the-api-token-secret]"
}'
