### Overview

_Features_ are the resources you want to protect in your app. The features page is where you add your app features to and create a key that links the two.

**Permission tab**

You can assign related permissions to the feature if you would like to protect the resource using the `useEntitlementsPermission` function. This function will allow you to protect a resource by using permissions only.

You can assign as many permissions as you wish to one feature. The best practice here would be to add the relevant permissions to the feature. For example; if you have an “SSO” feature, you can add `sso.read` and `sso.write` to the permission list \[link to permission doc\]. If a user will have one of the permissions (granted by their role), they will be entitled to use the SSO feature.

In order to link permission to a feature follow these steps:

1. Click on the permission tab
2. Click "Assign permissions"
3. Choose the relevant permissions
4. Click Assign permissions and save.

#### Next steps

When adding a new feature, users won't access it until you'll assign it into a bundle and grant the bundle to users or accounts. Go to feature bundle guide to learn how to create and manage a bundle.
