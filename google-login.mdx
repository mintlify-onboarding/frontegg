To enable your users to login with Google, you must enable Google login in the builder and then create an application with Google to serve as the OAuth provider.

Read below to learn how.

### Enabling Google Social Login In Builder

Go to **Home** and click on the Login Box builder.

In the left panel, toggle the switch to _on_ for Google.

#### Step 1: Open Project

In order to create your OAuth application, go to your \[Google Developers Console\] ([https://console.developers.google.com/](https://console.developers.google.com/)). In the dropdown at the top of the page, select your project.

#### Step 3: Create a Client ID

Return to **Credentials** menu and create an OAuth2 Client ID.

* For **Application Type**, select "Web Application".
* For **Authorized JavaScript Origins**, set your application URI (for example, http://localhost:3000).
* For **Authorized Redirect URIs**, set your redirect URI (for example, http://localhost:3000/account/social/success).

Enter your Google Client ID, Client Secret, and Redirect URL. Then save and publish.

#### Step 5: Test Google Button

On your login screen, you should see a **Google** button that redirects to the Google OAuth Consent screen for login. Test it to make sure it works.

### Customizing Authentication Scopes for Google

Customizing Scopes for Google Social Login

Scopes let you specify exactly what type of information your application can fetch from your users after they grant it access— and the generated access token includes these approved scopes. Frontegg currently fetches a _user profile_ and _user email_ as default scopes when users authenticate via their Google account. You can add additional, custom scopes to your social login via your Frontegg portal. To do so, go to \[_Environment name_\] > Authentication > Social login > Custom > Scopes. You can check Google's supported scopes [here](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes).

### Supporting Google One Tap

The Frontegg login dialog supports Google One Tap out of the box. The Google One Tap will show on supported browsers by default for both hosted login and embedded login.

In order to allow Google One tap, a change in the go to your \[Google Developers Console\] ([https://console.developers.google.com/](https://console.developers.google.com/)) is required. On your Google Developers Console, Go to OAuth project and OAuth credentials, your credentials and add the following under `Authorized JavaScript origins`:

* For hosted login mode, add https://\[YOUR-FRONTEGG-DOMAIN\]/oauth
* For embedded login mode, add https://\[YOUR-APP-URL\] (In case of using http://localhost:\[PORT\] add http://localhost as well for the Google One Tap to load correctly)
