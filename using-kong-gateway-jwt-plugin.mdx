title: "Kong Gateway JWT Backend Protection"
---

The [Kong API Gateway](https://konghq.com/) is another great method to accept traffic to your cluster.  
By using the [Kong JWT plugin ](https://docs.konghq.com/hub/kong-inc/jwt/) you can validate the requests to your API for authentication

> ### ðŸ“˜

> Using Kong plugins
> 
> This guide will not go into the required steps of installing plugins on top of the Kong API GW.  
> The assumption is that you have managed to install the plugin and use the configuration below

**Create a service**

cURL

`curl -i -f -X POST http://localhost:8001/services \
    --data "name=my-cool-service" \
    --data "url=http://httpbin.org"
`

**Then create a route on kong**

cURL

`curl -i -f -X POST http://localhost:8001/routes \
    --data "service.id={my-cool-service's id}" \
    --data "paths[]=/test"
`

**Add the JWT plugin to this route**

cURL

`curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/route/{route id}/plugins \
    --data "name=jwt"
`

**Creating the kong consumer**  
In order to create the kong consumer, we will use REST API

cURL

`curl -d "custom_id=SOME_CONSUMER_ID" http://kong:8001/consumers/
`

**Copy the JWT public key from the Frontegg portal**

![](/images/2d78bc5-jwt-settings.png "jwt-settings.png")

**Create a new RS256 JWT credential**

cURL

`` curl -i -X POST http://localhost:8001/consumers/{consumer}/jwt \
    -F "algorithm=RS256" \
    -F "rsa_public_key=[THE-PUBLIC-KEY-FROM-THE-PORTAL]" \
    -F "key=https://{workspace-url}.frontegg.com/" # the `iss` field
 ``

> ### ðŸ“˜
> 
> Issuer validations
> 
> The configuration above will validate that the issuer of the JWT is the Frontegg workspace domain. The `iss` claim is validated by default by the Kong JWT plugin

**Testing**  
You can test your configuration by calling the test endpoint with JWT signed by Frontegg

cURL

`curl -i http://localhost:8000/test \
    -H "Host:example.com" \
    -H "Authorization:Bearer <TOKEN-FROM-FRONTEGG>"
`
