Frontegg allows developers to subscribe to webhooks to trigger automation workflows based on actions occurring in Frontegg's servers. 

Examples of use cases include:

* Registering user on internal DB when the user is invited
* Send marketing email to the user upon first login
* Generate specific transactional flows based on login actions

Read below to learn how to subscribe to webhooks.

### Configuring and Subscribing to Webhooks

Follow the steps below to subscribe to webhook events.

#### Step 1: Create a new webhook connection

In your Frontegg Portal, go to **Environments âžœ \[NAME OF ENVIRONMENT\] âžœ Integrations**.

The page lists all your webhooks and has a button for adding a new webhook.

Click on the **Connect** button next to **Webhooks**, fill the webhook details for display name choose the events you want to subscribe to.

#### Step 2: Enter URL Address

Enter the URL at which you will receive the webhook data. The URL acts like an address that Frontegg can send a JSON message to when the assigned events happen.

Here is an example of the structure and content of the JSON.

json

`{
  "user": {
    "id": "35639902-a53d-44c3-9aea-066b06569f78",
    "email": "[[emailÂ protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)",
    "verified": null,
    "name": "cheli",
    "phoneNumber": null,

    "metadata": "{}",
    "tenantIds": [

    ],
    "tenantId": "adf4c0a5-9a5e-4c51-a228-d008050c0e15",

  },
  "eventContext": {

    "userId": "35639902-a53d-44c3-9aea-066b06569f78" //note: userID is optional
    
  },
  "eventKey": "frontegg.user.created"
}
`

#### STEP 3: Test

To pass the test, make sure your URL endpoint is up and running and will return a 200 response to the webhook request.

> Any **4XX** code will be registered as failure  
> The response body can remain empty.

### Security

**Protecting your requests with a Secret Key:**

You can set a **Secret Key** for each webhook connection your create.  
Just go to **Settings** Tab , under **Secret key** Enter a value that is confidential. Frontegg will generate a header called `x-webhook-secret` and sign the webhook request using the secret.  
For enhanced security, Frontegg recommends that you use the webhook secret.

In order to verify the hook's signature using `x-webhook-secret` header, you should use a method from your backend library. 

For example, for Node.js you could use the below function:

JavaScript

`jwt.verify(<x-webhook-secret-value>, <the secret in the dashboard on bhook settings>)
`
