At Frontegg, nothing is more important to us than safeguarding users and their sensitive data. As your authentication provider, we extend that care to your app, making sure your app can be as secure as you want it to be with the most up-to-date security protocols.

To accomplish that, we offer a suite of security features to ensure the highest level of protection for our app. But as with anything on Frontegg, your level of security is completely customizable. Security often comes at the expense of user experience, so you can choose where on that balance your app fits.

Instead of implementing security features like token expiration, session management, and MFA yourself, Frontegg makes securing your app as easy as toggling _On_ a few features. 

Security for your app also means that you can control how customers configure their account security level through the Frontegg Admin Portal.

Frontegg offers a versatile range of authentication capabilities to ensure the security and flexibility of your application's login process. Users can choose their preferred authentication methods, making the login experience tailored to their preferences. These capabilities include traditional password and modern passwordless authentication, as well as passkeys for quick and secure access.
