### Styling Architecture

To know what and how to style, it is important to understand that the Frontegg style architecture is a top-down tree where each level in the tree merges up. 

The styles at any given level apply unless overridden by a conflicting style below it on the same branch.

The image below demonstrates this top-down approach.  
  
![2048](/images/6da8bf5-image.png "image.png")   

The Frontegg style architecture defines some global customization styles that can be applied both on the login-box and admin portal as well as customization styles that you can apply on each and every one of them separately.

The idea is that you can always reach the level of customization you need within the granularity that your application requires. 

This top-down approach makes it easy to customize components that share the same design regardless of where the component appears in your application. But it also allows for the precision you need for uniquely styling specific parts of your application.

The `FronteggThemeOptions` interface is the main interface that controls the entire customization of the Frontegg application.  


```TypeScript TypeScript
export interface FronteggThemeOptions {
    palette?: ThemePaletteOptions;
    typographyStyleOptions?: CSSProperties;
    spacing?: SpacingOptions;
    shadows?: Shadows;
    transitions?: TransitionsOptions;
    breakpoints?: BreakpointsOptions;
    direction?: Direction;
    components?: ComponentsOptions;
    typography?: TypographyOptions;
    adminPortal?: AdminPortalThemeOptions;
    loginBox?: LoginBoxThemeOptions;
}
```

As shown in the snippet above, the top-most level is the global level. A style applied at the global level impacts all Frontegg components unless you explicitly override that style at a lower level.  
  
<Note>
 
 **Frontegg + Material-UI = üíö**
 
 Frontegg base components rely on the great [Material UI](https://mui.com/) (as we believe that wheels shouldn't be re-invented). Therefore, some of the links you see below will refer to the documentation of Material UI.
</Note>
  
The customization options split into the following (no worries, we will go deeper for each of the components when we slide along this guide).  
  
| Attribute              | Description                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| palette                | Color palette representing the main colors of the application                                                               |
| typographyStyleOptions | Inline CSS representing the font options                                                                                    |
| spacing                | Styles for spacing options                                                                                                  |
| shadows                | Styles for generic shadow configurations                                                                                    |
| transitions            | Defines generic behaviors for CSS transitions (how fast they go etc.)                                                       |
| breakpoints            | Defines breakpoints for different resolutions (CSS media like)                                                              |
| direction              | LeftToRight \| RightToLeft                                                                                                  |
| components             | Allows to override ALL of the material-ui components styles we are using such as: MuiAlert, MuiAutocomplete, MuiButton etc. |
| typography             | Defines which fonts to use and which fonts families                                                                         |
| loginBox               | Customization options for the Login Box (more info [here](/docs/login-box-style-customization))                             |
| adminPortal            | Customization options for the Admin Portal (more info [here](/docs/admin-portal-introduction))                              |

  
### Code Integration and Structure

First, this guide shows you how to integrate the `themeOptions` object into your code. Then, it explains the structure of the `themeOptions` object so that you can customize your styles.

#### Integration

When [integrating the Frontegg Provider](/docs/adding-frontegg-to-your-app), pass `themeOptions` as an initialization attribute. The value for `themeOptions` needs to be an object containing your custom styles. 

For example, here is a simple example that sets the `fontFamily` at the global level to monospace:  


```JavaScript JavaScript
import { FronteggProvider } from "@frontegg/react";

const contextOptions = {
  baseUrl: "https://your-application.frontegg.com",
};

const themeOptions = {
   typographyStyleOptions: {
      fontFamily: 'staatliches',
  },
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <FronteggProvider
    contextOptions={contextOptions}
    themeOptions={themeOptions}
  >
    <App />
  </FronteggProvider>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

The image below shows the result of this code example where the font is monospace:  
  
![](/images/4aea7da-small-Screenshot_2023-05-10_at_15.02.43.png)

  
#### Master Object

Your `themeOptions` object can contain custom styles for all the available levels. 

Here is an object containing all levels and their corresponding styling options.

```JavaScript JavaScript
const themeOptions = {
  // Global styles 
  palette: ThemePalette;
  typographyStyleOptions: CSSProperties;
  spacing: Spacing;
  shadows: Shadows;
  transitions: Transitions;
  breakpoints: Breakpoints;
  direction: Direction;
  components: ComponentsOptions;
  typography: Typography;
  
  // Login Box styles 
  loginBox: {
    // Easier way to load predefined themes
    themeName: 'classic' | 'modern' | 'vivid' | 'dark';
    // Specific customization options for the accept invitation page
    acceptInvitation: AcceptInvitationPageTheme;
    // Specific customization options for the activate account page
    activateAccount: ActivateAccountPageTheme;
    // Specific customization options for the forgot password page
    forgotPassword: ForgotPasswordPageTheme;
    // Specific customization options for the reset password page
    resetPassword: ResetPasswordPageTheme;
    // Specific customization options for the login page
    login: LoginPageTheme;
    // Specific customization options for the signup page
    signup: SignupPageTheme;
    // Specific customization options for the social logins section
    socialLogins: SocialLoginsTheme;
    // Specific customization options for the loader of the login box
    loader: LoaderTheme;
   },
       
   // Admin Portal styles 
   adminPortal: {
     palette?: ThemePalette;
     typographyStyleOptions?: Partial<CSSProperties>;
     spacing?: SpacingOptions;
     shadows?: Shadows;
     transitions?: TransitionsOptions;
     breakpoints?: BreakpointsOptions;
     direction?: Direction;
     components?: ComponentsOptions;
     typography?: TypographyOptions;
     layout: {
       fullScreenMode: boolean;
     };
   }
};
```

You do not need this entire master object in your code. Instead, just include styles for properties where you want to override the default.

  
<Note>

**Types of Custom Styles**

If you are using typescript, the interface for the style options is exposed and you can easily import it to see what options are available.

`import { FronteggAppOptions } from '@frontegg/types';`

If you are not using typescript, look in the frontegg package for the `frontegg/types` folder to see the style options.
</Note>
  
### Customization and Styling Through Code

Fully customize your Frontegg components to match your brand and business. In addition to the **_styling ease_** provided by our trailblazing builders, by making the customization interface open for you to write your own styles, text, and code flows, we also provide you **_complete styling and messaging control_**.

We understand from first-hand experience the level of granularity and control developers can accomplish writing their own code. Plus, why stop at style customizations when you can customize the text, too.

### Advanced Styling and Customization

Our unique builder to enable you to easily create, customize, and deploy login flows to your web and applications. 

While on boarding, you design your intial login box. Right after that you can go back to the builder and continue crafting, and designing your login with various login methods such as SSO, Social logins, Password, or Passwordless logins. Additionally there are components that can help you create login pages that match your branding and design requirements. 

One of the key benefits of using a builder for login flows is that it reduces the development time and cost required to build such functionality from scratch. The builder eliminates the need for you to write code and maintain login flows. This, in turn, allows you to focus on your core competencies while leaving the login flow design to us.

Within the Frontegg builder, you are able to modify two main products that we offer. The first and core one is the **Login Box**, the second one is our **Admin Portal** \- designed for self service. In this section we will demonstrate all the capabilities available while designing and managing each one within the builder.
