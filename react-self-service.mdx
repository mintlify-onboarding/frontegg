React.js

`const handleClick = () => {
  AdminPortal.show();

> With the new react-router peer dependency, it is required to pass your `history` from the `useHistory` hook as another prop to the `ContextProvider`.

  
Here is an example of how to pass your `history` from the `useHistory` hook as another prop to the `ContextProvider`:

  
React.js

`import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';
import './index.css';
import { createBrowserHistory } from "history";
import { FronteggProvider } from '@frontegg/react';

const contextOptions = {
  baseUrl: 'https://[YOUR_SUBDOMAIN].frontegg.com',
};

const history = createBrowserHistory();

// Replace this with your app logo ðŸ‘‡
const headerImage = 'https://assets.frontegg.com/public-frontegg-assets/acme-logo.svg';

ReactDOM.render(
  <Router history={history}>
    <FronteggProvider history={history} contextOptions={contextOptions} headerImage={headerImage}>
      <App />
    </FronteggProvider>
  <Router />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
`

**You are good to go!**  You should now see the admin portal in your application and able to use our full self-served experience with your product.
