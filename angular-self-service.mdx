## Admin Portal Integration

Embed the admin portal into your application by following this guide.  
  
For Frontegg admin portal integration, we will import the `FronteggAppService` from the `@frontegg/angular` package and use `showAdminPortal` method when clicking on the relevant button.  
  
Angular.js

`import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { FronteggAppService } from '@frontegg/angular';

@Component({
  selector: 'show-admin-portal',
  template: '<button (click)="showAdminPortal()">Show Admin Portal</button>',
})
export class ShowAdminPortalComponent {
  constructor(private fronteggAppService: FronteggAppService) { }

  showAdminPortal(): void {
    this.fronteggAppService?.showAdminPortal()
  }
}
`

  
**You are good to go!**  You should now see the admin portal in your application and able to use our full self-served experience with your product.
