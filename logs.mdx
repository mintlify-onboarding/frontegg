### Logged Events

Logs in your Frontegg portal allow you to view and analyze activity performed within your app and on additional third-party apps you are integrated with. You can use this feature for troubleshooting and debugging, and to monitor your users' activity. Logs will start to appear after completing your basic Frontegg integration and will include logs for events that are mentioned in the [Logged Events](/docs/logged-events) list.
