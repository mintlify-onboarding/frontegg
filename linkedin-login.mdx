title: "Linkedin login"
---

### Overview

Adding social login to your login page allows users to sign in to your website or application using their existing social media accounts, such as Facebook, Google, or Linkedin. This can make the login process faster and more convenient for users, as they don't have to create a new account or remember a separate username and password.

To enable LinkedIn social login to your login page, you will need to 

1. Enable LinkedIn as a social login in the builder
2. Create LinkedIn Credentials in the environments

### Prerequisite

#### Enable LinkedIn login in the Builder

* On the Homepage click “Go to Builder”
* Toggle on the LinkedIn social login placed in the left panel (please note - you can have up to four social logins on your login page)
* Click “Review to Publish” button and “Publish to Dev”

### Customizing Authentication Scopes for LinkedIn

Customizing Scopes for LinkedIn Social Login

Scopes let you specify exactly what type of information your application can fetch from your users after they grant it access— and the generated access token includes these approved scopes. Frontegg currently fetches a _user profile_ and _user email_ as default scopes when users authenticate with their LinkedIn account. You can add additional, custom scopes to your social login via your Frontegg portal. To do so, go to \[_Environment name_\] > Authentication > Social login > Custom > Scopes.
