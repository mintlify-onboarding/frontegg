Hosted login with OpenID Connect (OIDC) is a secure and flexible authentication and authorization protocol that allows organizations to delegate user authentication to a trusted identity provider (IdP). OIDC builds on top of OAuth 2.0, providing additional features for identity verification and access control.

This following topic will walk you through the steps of configuring your Frontegg environment as an IDP for a 3rd party service.

> This capability is fully supported if you are using **Frontegg Hosted Login**. If you are using Frontegg Embedded Login, social and SSO login methods will not redirect the end user to the 3rd party application out of the box.

Some of the use cases for this scenario can be:

* Allow your users to login with the same identity on their docs
* To have several applications sharing the same identity
* To add additional internal applications sharing the same identity for internal use cases

**Tools used for this tutorial**  
For the sake of this tutorial, we will be using [OIDC playgroup](https://openidconnect.net/) as the 3rd party service.

OIDC playground is a great tool to test and debug OIDC flows.  
Frontegg implements OIDC (OpenID Connect) by default as part of its hosted login offering.

**Getting started**  
Under your hosted login configuration (Environment --> Authentication --> Login Method), make sure that the following are configured: 

* Hosted login is enabled
* The redirectUrl of the service provider (in this `https://openidconnect.net/callback`) is configured under the allowed redirect URLs

On your service provider configure the authorization URL and the clientId of your Frontegg workspace.

On the 3rd party client side, set the `authorize endpoint` and the `token endpoint` as well as the `clientId` and `secret` respectively (in case PKCE is supported by your 3rd party service, you can omit the secret)

The OpenID connect endpoint will match the following:

| Description                  | URL                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| OpenID connect discovery     | https://{YOUR-ENV-URL}}/.well-known/openid-configuration |
| Authorization Token Endpoint | https://{YOUR-ENV-URL}}/oauth/authorize                  |
| Token Endpoint               | https://{YOUR-ENV-URL}}/oauth/token                      |
| Token Keys Endpoint          | https://{YOUR-ENV-URL}}/.well-known/jwks.json            |

After running the flow on your 3rd party client and getting the Frontegg `id_token` the JWT should be validated with the `jwks` and result in a valid user
