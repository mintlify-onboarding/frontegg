To enable your users to login with GitHub, you must enable GitHub login in the builder and then create an application with GitHub to serve as the OAuth provider.

Read below to learn how.

## Enable In Builder

Go to **Home** and click on the Login Box builder.

In the left panel, toggle the switch to _on_ for GitHub.

### Step 1: Register an Application

On your GitHub account, navigate to your `Organization Account Settings`.

> You do not need to have a GitHub Organization to allow GitHub social login. If using your personal account, in GitHub visit Settings ➜ Developer Settings ➜ OAuth Apps ➜ New OAuth App and follow similar steps.

  
### Step 2: Generate Credentials

Now that your application is created, you should be redirected to the application configuration screen.

Under `Client secrets`, click on `Generate a new client secret` and save the generated secret.

Click on the GitHub manage button.

### Step 4: Test GitHub Button

In your login screen, you should see a **GitHub** button that redirects to the GitHub OAuth Consent screen for login. Test it to make sure it works.

### Customizing Authentication Scopes for GitHub

Customizing Scopes for Github Social Login

Scopes let you specify exactly what type of information your application can fetch from your users after they grant it access— and the generated access token includes these approved scopes. Frontegg currently fetches a _user profile_ and _user email_ as default scopes when users authenticate via their Github account. You can add additional, custom scopes to your social login via your Frontegg portal. To do so, go to \[_Environment name_\] > Authentication > Social login > Custom > Scopes. You can check Github's supported scopes [here](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps).
