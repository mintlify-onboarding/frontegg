Frontegg apps come with 7 built-in defenses. Each one of them can be configured to do something different when they get triggered. For example, you can choose to allow stale users to continue to your app but block them if they try to use a breached password.

Here are the options for each one:

| Defense                           | Description                                                                           | Allow                          | Challenge                 | Block | Lock |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------- | ----- | ---- |
| Let the user continue to your app | Challenge the user with MFA. If they pass, let them continue                          | Block the user from logging in | Lock the user immediately |       |      |

| Suspicious IPs                    | Identify suspicious IPs activity and either detect and allow or prevent the threat    | ✅                              | ✅                         | ✅     | ✅    |

When you want to change your policy on a defense Frontegg offers, users with an _Admin_ [Role](/docs/roles-1) can do so from the Security Rules page in any environment.
