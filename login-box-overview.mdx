### Getting Started with Your Login Box

When you go to the [Builder](/docs/builder-2) section of your [Frontegg Portal](/docs/login-box-1), you will find your Login Box. The Login box is the visual authentication element (box) that your users will see, and you can control its visual elements such as social login options, and a single sign-on button, and adapt its color theme to your liking.

* Select your application tech stack
* Choose the environment and enter your destination URL
* Open the Login Box in the browser and click the publish to dev button in the Portal
