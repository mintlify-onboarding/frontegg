title: "Granular Admin Portal Access"
---

The [Entitlements Engine](/docs/entitlements) offers multiple ways to control user access to designated Features/content granularly. The engine allows you to control your user's access to various admin portal capabilities via your Frontegg Portal. You can limit which sections your users can see in their Admin Portal and their permissions within those sectionsâ€” For instance, you can assign users with a _Read Only_ or _Edit_ permissions (table of permissions can be viewed [here](#supported-permissions). By creating a _Feature Bundle_ inclusive of the specific features you pick, you can create dedicated subscription plans, and also upsell features for current users.

### Entitling User Access to Specific Admin Portal Areas

To harness the power of this ability and assign your users access to specific Admin Portal areas, do the following: 

**Step 1: Enable Entitlements in your SDK** 

Your first step would be to enable the Entitlements Engine in your frontend _Entitlement SDK_. Choose your tech stack from the main menu under **Frontend SDKs**. Each SDK includes an _Entitlement Integration SDK_. 

JSX

`entitlementsOptions={{
    enabled: true }}
`

**Step 2: Create Dedicated Features and Feature Bundles**

1. In your Frontegg Portal, go to your environment, choose the _Entitlements_ tab, and then _Features_.
2. Create Features for each section of the Admin portal you wish to protect. Should you wish to limit access to Single Sign On (SSO) for instance, do the following:  
   1. Go to _Add new feature_ give it a Key name and save it.  
   ![](/images/e655956-Screenshot_2023-10-11_at_19.39.52.png)  
   2. Go to the _Plans_ tab and create a new _Plan_. Add the feature you created previously to that bundle.  
   ![](/images/c3afe55-Screenshot_2023-10-11_at_19.53.26.png)  
   3. Assign all the users that you wish to grant access to this feature. Click _Save_.  
   ![](/images/f406868-Screenshot_2023-10-11_at_19.54.10.png)  
   4. Go back to the _SSO feature_ and add the relevant permission to it (in this case - `fe.secure.read.samlConfiguration`). Check the _Supported Permissions_ section below to see all supported permissions.  
   ![](/images/eaa9652-Screenshot_2023-10-11_at_20.00.22.png)  
   5. ![](/images/0cb5e2b-Screenshot_2023-10-11_at_20.00.49.png)  
   6. ![](/images/2f4b4b5-Screenshot_2023-10-11_at_20.00.58.png)  
   Once this step is done, users who didnâ€™t get access to the feature (via the Feature Bundle) will not be able to see this section in the Admin portal.

> Important note

> Users that were entitled to write or delete SSO will still be able to do so via API, even if they are not assigned to this feature via the bundle and in that case it will not be visible to them in the Admin Portal.

### Supported Permissions

### Entitling User Access Based on `AuthorizedContent`

In addition to user [Entitlements](/reference/entitlements-1) \- which grant users access to specific app [Features](/reference/features-1), [Feature flags](/reference/feature-flags-1) , etc. - you can also control user access to specific areas in your app based on their role. To do so, the system will first check their login status (logged-in/out), redirect logged-out users back to the login page, and if the user is already logged in, it will check their designated [Role](/docs/managing-roles-v2) against the content they're allowed to view and showcase that corresponding content. 

> ### ðŸš§
> 
> Feature Support
> 
> The following feature is currently supported in React only.

To do so, you need to wrap the content you want to protect with an `AuthorizedContent` component. That component has a `requiredRoles` prop that you pass as an array of role-names into.

Before showing the user any content, the `AuthorizedContent` component checks the user's role against the list of required roles for the content you wrapped in advance, and subsequently, It will show the content associated with the role that user was entitled to. 

App.jsx

`import { AuthorizedContent, useAuthUser } from "@frontegg/react";

function App() {
  // This will redirect to login in case we are not logged in
  const user = useAuthUser();

  return (
    <div className="App">
      Logged in as {user?.name}

      <AuthorizedContent requiredRoles={['Admin']} >
          <div>
              Private area for admins
          </div>
      </AuthorizedContent>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
`

### Redirecting Users to Login

When a user tries to access specific app areas, but the system identifies that they are not logged in, you can enact a `useAuthUser` hook that checks whether a user is logged in or not. In case the user is _not_ logged in, the hook will redirect them back to the login page. If the user _is_ logged in (as in the code sample below), the component will then display a _Logged in as_ alongside the user's name instead of redirecting them.  
  
App.jjsx

`import { useAuthUser } from "@frontegg/react";

function App() {
  // This will redirect to login in case we are not logged in
  const user = useAuthUser();

  return (
    <div className="App">
      Logged in as {user?.name}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
`
