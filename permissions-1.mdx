### What are Permissions in Frontegg?

Permissions are essential for controlling user access to information and functionality in your application.

Permissions represent the ability to do something in your app, e.g., deleting users or editing a profile page. Permissions are strongly linked to [Roles](/docs/roles-1), since a _role_ is essentially a group of permissions. Each user has one or more roles that define what they can perform in your app. 

To get you started quickly, Frontegg comes with a robust collection of default permissions, that are related to the features we give you within the admin box. Additionally, you can set **Custom Permissions** to use in addition to or instead of your preset Frontegg Permissions. Read below to learn more.

> Note that you need to enable (toggle-on) the Admin Portal areas you want to give users access to. Otherwise, giving them permissions or roles including specific permissions will have no effect as the areas will remain hidden.

### Creating and Granting Permissions

As mentioned in the _Prerequisite_ box above, giving users access to Admin Portal areas is essential for them to see these tabs. The first step before granting them permissions is, therefore, to _toggle on_ the different areas in your app you want them to access, like so:

#### Where to manage permissions for your app

Permissions exist for every environment. The permission tab is located at **{Environment Name} â†’ Entitlements â†’ Permissions**

### Frontegg Permissions and Default Settings

Frontegg's set of permissions provides you and your customer the granularity to select which users can do what from within your admin box.

Examples include permissions to perform actions such as _Give access to sub accounts_, _Edit group roles_, _Delegation_, etc. 

Permissions impact the actions your users can take in the admin portal in your application. Frontegg's Permissions list is fixed and cannot be edited or deleted. All Frontegg permissions begin with an **fe** prefix (such as `fe.connectivity.read.eventCategories`). 

### User and Tenant Permissions in the Admin Portal

When granting users [Roles](/docs/roles-1) and permissions, you can determine which tabs they see in the Admin Portal. See the table below for a quick reference on which permission controls what tab (note that the following refers to `read` permissions; there are `write` and `delete` permissions as well (for example, `fe.secure.read.users` also has `fe.secure.write.users` and `fe.secure.delete.users`). You can always use the search bar to see all available permissions under each category. 

| Category            | Permission              | Key                              | Location in Portal    |
| ------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Security Policies   | Read securityPolicies   | fe.secure.read.securityPolicy    | Privacy & Security    |
| Audits              | Read audits             | fe.secure.read.audits            | Audit logs            |
| API Tokens          | Read tenant API tokens  | fe.secure.read.tenantApiTokens   | API tokens            |
| API Tokens          | Read user API tokens    | fe.secure.read.userApiTokens     | Personal tokens       |
| User Management     | Read users              | fe.secure.read.users             | Users                 |
| Account Settings    | Read securityPolicies   | fe.secure.read.accountSettings   | Account details       |
| Webhook Integration | Read webhooks           | fe.connectivity.read.webhooks    | Webhooks              |
| SAML                | Read SAML configuration | fe.secure.read.samlConfiguration | fe.secure.read.audits |

#### Wildcard and Global Permissions

In addition to individual permissions, you can add global permissions to users. Use the `*` in the search bar to see all permissions supported for this functionality. When granting a user with an `fe.secure.read.*` permission, you are granting the user with global `read` permissions (in comparison to`fe.secure.read.samlDefaultRoles` which grants a much more granular capability). `fe.secure.*` permission, for example, will grant users complete `read` **and** `write` permissions.

### Permission Properties

Each permission has the following properties:

| Property    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name        | The permission name.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Description | The description is intended to help you and your teammates understand the permission internally.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Category    | Categories serve as simple holding folders for a group of related permissions. This is true of both **Frontegg Permissions** and **Custom Permissions**.Each Frontegg Permission is already assigned to a category and cannot be reassigned to a different one. For each Custom Permission, you must assign it to a category, and you can edit which category it belongs to. Although organized in categories, each permission must be edited individually. |
| Key         | An internal identifier that must be unique. As a best practice, a permissions key should include the name of the resource and the action it is protecting. For example, If I want to protect SAML configuration with permissions, I would add three permissions with different actions:fe.secure.delete.samlConfigurationfe.secure.read.samlConfigurationfe.secure.write.samlConfiguration                                                                  |
| ID          | Each permission has a unique ID that is generated automatically upon creation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

### Permissions table and actions

In the permissions dashboard, you can view all supported permissions, search for specific ones and assign them roles.

1. **Search bar** \- gives you the option to search for a specific permission
2. **Filters** \- you can filter permissions by category and the creator (you or Frontegg)
3. **Assign Roles** \- Assign roles to permissions. When roles are assigned to permissions, the permissions become part of the Roles' subset featuresâ€” I.e., every user assigned with that specific role will be entitled to perform its subset set of permissions.

1. **Delete a permission** \- use the three dots on the right side of each permission to delete it.

### Creating and Editing Permissions

##### Create a new permission by clicking the "Add New Permission" button.

The Settings tab includes the following fields: 

| Field               | Description                                                                                         |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name (required)     | Add a descriptive name for your permission                                                          |
| Description         | We advise you to add a description that will help you and other teammates manage the permissions.   |
| Category (required) | Choose a category from the category list. You can assign an existing category, or create a new one. |
| Key (required)      | add a unique key, which will be used to identify the permission and will be added to your code.     |

To add new permission, press the _Add new permission button_, and fill in the _Name_, _Category,_ and _Key \_fields. The \_Key_ field is the unique identifier stored in the user JWT.
