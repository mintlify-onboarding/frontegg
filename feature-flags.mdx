title: "Feature Flags"

With Feature Flags, you can safely test features in production and allow designated access to internal teams, beta customers, QA new features, and more. Frontegg's feature flagging utilizes the `isEntitledTo` query to wrap specific areas of your app with designated access according to a user's associated **attributes**. 

### Getting Started with Feature Flags

Feature flags are built atop existing features. So, to _flag_ a feature, you initially need to create one via the features' dashboard. To create a feature, go to **Entitlements --> Features**. Learn more about creating features [here](/docs/features).

### Creating a New Feature Flag

To create a new feature flag, go to **Entitlements --> Feature Flags**. Press the _Create feature flag_ button and use the drop-down menu to choose the feature you want to flag from your features list.

### Feature Flag Settings

Each feature flag has a _Settings_ and a _Targeting_ tab. The _Settings_ tab includes fields like the flag's name and linked its features, and the _Targeting_ tab includes the targeting rules you create for your flag.

### Adding Targeting Rules

To create designated access to a feature flag, go to _Add new targeting rules_ and select the attributes you wish to apply for that specific flag.

Add targeting rules via the 'Add new targeting rules' button.

#### Attributes for Targeting

The default attributes we currently support for feature flagging are: _email verified_ (`frontegg.emailVerified`), _user Id_ (`frontegg.userId`), _tenant Id_ (`frontegg.tenantId`), and _email_ (`frontegg.email`). These attributes are included in the drop-down attributes menu. In addition to frontegg attributes, _Custom_ attributes can also be used. Learn more about custom attributes in the following section.

### Custom Attributes

You have the flexibility to create custom attributes that for rule-based/feature flagging purposes. When creating a custom attribute, the attribute _Key_ will be useful when you insert it in the targeting rules field (see below).

#### JWT Attributes

In addition to _Custom_ attributes and default _Frontegg attributes_, you can target attributes from the user's JWT. Since we _flat_ the `jwt` object, you can access its nested properties, including arrays. For example, if you store information such as the user's date of birth as `dateOfBirth`, you can target this attribute in your feature flagging engine by inserting a `jwt.dateOfBirth` in the attribute field. For JWT attributes, you need to use the `jwt` prefix.
