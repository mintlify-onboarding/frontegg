> We highly recommend using Custom Domains to avoid third party cookie-issues and this recommendation is appies to both _Embedded_ and _Hosted_ login customers. Since it is very cumbersome to switch to a custom domain after you've gone live - and especially if you have active SSO connections - we encourage you to configure custom domains in your Production environment from the get-go. Learn more about [Custom Domains](/docs/custom-domains).

#### Configuring OpenID in Your Frontegg Portal

Go to **Environments âžœ \[NAME OF ENVIRONMENT\] âžœ Authentication âžœ SSO**.

> 
> SSO/OpenID Enablement
> 
> If you do not see SSO âžœ OpenID in the sidebar, make sure it is enabled and [published to the environment](/docs/adding-sso).

After clicking the OpenID _Manage_ button, insert your redirect URL and save the changes. If you are using the **Hosted login** method, the Redirect URL should be **https://\[your-frontegg-domain\].frontegg.com/oauth/account/oidc/callback.**

If you are using the **Embedded Login** method, the Redirect URL should be \[your-application-url\]/account/saml/callback, for example: **http://localhost:3000/account/oidccallback**.

> ### ðŸš§
> 
> When using a custom domain
> 
> We strongly encourage you to configure a [custom domain](/docs/adding-custom-domain) in your Frontegg app before configuring your OpenID connection, as it may require some downtime to change it retroactively _after_ configuring your connection. Custom Domains are beneficial for a number of reasons, such as avoiding cookie issues and enhancing your brand. Learn more about [Custom Domains](/docs/custom-domains).
> 
> If you opt **not** to configure a custom domain, use your `frontegg subdomain` followed by `/auth/oidc/callback` for your ACS URL.

### Allow your customers to apply the connection or apply it for them

After configuring OIDC in the Frontegg Portal, you can allow your end users either to apply the SSO connection via the Self-service or apply the connection details from their IDP on their behalf, via the Backoffice âžœ Accounts âžœ Account âžœ Actions SSO âžœ Configurations.

##### Enable SSO Tab in the Admin portal

For enabling the SSO tab in the Self-Service for your end users:

> ### ðŸš§
> 
> Admin portal integration
> 
> Make sure that you have integrated the Admin portal into your application as described in (doc:react-self-service).

After the SSO tab is enabled, your customers can follow the instructions for adding the details of the connection from the IDP - [here](/docs/saml-idp-instructions). 

For OpenID there is no option to map roles to groups from the Self-Service UI (Admin portal). It can be applied only via [APIs](/reference/ssorolescontrollerv1%5Fsetssodefaultroles) or the Backoffice.

##### Apply the connection from the Environment Backoffice

For applying the SSO connection on behalf of your customers, you can use the back office or do it by using our APIs.
