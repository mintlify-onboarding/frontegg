title: "Email Templates"

Emails sent from your app are triggered by events occurring in your app and are the forefront communication method you have with your customers. Frontegg comes with email templates enabled from the start. 

When an important event occurs, your application automatically emails the user the corresponding email template. 

Frontegg comes with pre-set email templates for each time a user:

* Activates their account
* Resets their password
* Invited to join a tenant
* Uses a breached password
* Requests a magic link
* Requests a one-time code
* Connects to a new device
* Used an invitation to join a tenant

Additionally, you can customize the content and design of each individual email template so that you can deliver your own message and match your brand. 

Read below to learn how to send customized emails about important account-related information in real-time.

## Customizing Email Templates

Follow the steps below to customize your email templates.

### Step 1: Select Email Templates

In your Frontegg Portal, go to **Environments ➜ \[NAME OF ENVIRONMENT\] ➜ Emails**.  
On the email page is a list of email templates. Almost all templates are enabled by default. 

You can see the status of each in the table. 

To change whether a template is enabled, click on the template and toggle it on or off.

> Be sure to manage the email templates in each environment separately.

  
Leave on as many or as few templates as you want. For each enabled template, your application will email the template to a user when the corresponding event occurs. 

Here is a table with a list of template names, descriptions, and triggering events:  
  
| Template Name      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Event                       | Available Variables                                                                             |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pwned Password     | When a user signs up with a password or changes it, Frontegg checks if the password is pwned.A pwned password is one that has previously been exposed in a data breach. Pwned passwords make your user accounts more vulnerable. | Login and signup            | nameemailphoneNumberprofilePictureUrltimesPwned                                                 |
| ActivateUser       | Email a user when they activate their account.                                                                                                                                                                                   | Account activation          | nameemailphoneNumberprofilePictureUrlredirectURL                                                |
| ResetPassword      | Email a user when they reset their password.                                                                                                                                                                                     | Password reset              | nameemailphoneNumberprofilePictureUrlredirectURL                                                |
| MagicLink          | One passwordless authentication method is using magic link. When a user logs in or signs up, they request a magic link that they then receive in their email and can click to authenticate.                                      | Login and signup            | nameemailphoneNumberprofilePictureUrlredirectURLexpires                                         |
| OTC                | Another passwordless authentication method is using a one-time code. When a user logs in or signs up, they request a code that they then receive in their email and use to authenticate.                                         | Login and signup            | nameemailphoneNumberprofilePictureUrlcode                                                       |

| Email verification | Email a user that signed up via Microsoft Social login method, to verify the email address                                                                                                                                       | Login and signup            | redirectURL                                                                                     |

> 
> Opting for Default?
> 
> There is no harm in leaving email templates in their default configuration. However, not all the templates will necessarily apply to your application depending upon how you configure it and some might require some configuration to work properly.

  
After enabling an email template, you can use the default content and styles or customize it. Read below to learn how to customize the email templates.

### Step 2: Customize Email Template

Our easy-to-use email template forms give you maximum customization capabilities for each template with minimal effort. 

Using our email template forms, you can set the content and appearance for each template individually. 

For instance, you can set the sender address, subject, redirect URL, message content, message format, logo, and more. 

You can even edit the HTML to give it the layout and design you want.

#### Form Inputs

Each template has its own set of form inputs. 

You will find some of the inputs are the same across all templates. Like from, from name, subject, and message. For each template, you can customize the value for each input. 

Some templates have additional inputs. For instance, several template forms include inputs for redirect URLs and some have an input for a message. 

You need to update each template separately.

Here is a table of additional inputs in some of the templates.  
  
| Input                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Redirect URL         | The root part of each redirect URL is:http://localhost:3000/. For instance, http://localhost:3000/account/reset-password.Replace "localhost:3000" with the URL of your app. Leave the second part of the default , for instance account/reset-password, exactly as is. The URL will be used in the email template for {redirectURL}. |
| Success Redirect URL | After completing the operation flow the user will be redirected to this URL.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Message              | HTML content of the template. Read more below.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

To use a variable, in the body of your HTML content, wrap the variable name in double curly braces like `{{name}}` or `{{tenantName}}` to the HTML template.

##### Layout and Design

Use the HTML Editor to set the layout and design for each template. Anything you can do in HTML, you can do here.

  
> ### 📘
> 
> Customized vs. Default
> 
> All email templates come ready to go, so no need to customize any of them. You also probably do not need to customize all of them. For instance, if you enable passwordless authentication, the MagicLink and OTC email templates make sense for you to customize, but you will not use the ResetPassword template, so no use in customizing it.
