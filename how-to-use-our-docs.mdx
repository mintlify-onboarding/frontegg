### Getting Started

Welcome to Frontegg’s Documentation! We've created this short guide to help you navigate our various documentation sections and to help you get the most out of our integrations and features. As you begin your Frontegg journey, you will probably begin at our documentation's homepage. The homepage has links to top features and common search topics. Direct your attention to the ‘Getting Started’ section, and check our

[Onboarding Toolkit](/docs/adding-frontegg-to-your-app) page— where we’ve listed ordered stages list for the best integration and feature setup. This will be your reference point thorough the integration process for understanding which stage of integration comes after which. 

### Portal Builder

After exploring the _Getting Started_ section, you will see the _Portal Builder_ tab. This tab consists of instructions for adjusting your Portal’s UI and also how to toggle features on/off and configure them for your use and your customers.

### Searching for Content

You can browse topics by categories or use the search bar for specific queries. The search bar can also assist you in finding specific content. Simply type in your query, and our smart search engine will provide you with the relevant topic.  
When navigating through the different sections, you'll find detailed explanations, step-by-step instructions, and often, screenshots and videos to make the process even more understandable. Take your time to read through the content carefully. We've designed our guides to be as informative and user-friendly as possible.  
Some of our articles contain interactive elements and code samples. You can copy and paste those directly into your projects.  
To keep the menu straightforward and easy to navigate, we tried to simplify the menu as much as possible, so each subcategory usually has a sub-menu of features to help you navigate to the inner pages. We’ve also included an Overview and a Features Tab in each section. The overview is a high level explanation of the topic and their respective use-cases, and the features tab has a sub-menu to navigate to the topic of each feature.

We have extensive SDK libraries. You have them listed and divided by Client-side, Server-side and Mobile.  
If you want to use our APIs, you can access them from the API Reference Tab at the top.

### Help Center

If you can't find the answer you're looking for, you can navigate to the help center from the top right and bottom menus— you can find our FAQs there and contact our Dev Success team if you need further help.
