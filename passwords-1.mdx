If you’re using a password as a login method, it’s important to set the following security settings. Frontegg follows the _OWASP_ (Open Web Application Security Project) guidelines, making your application and customer accounts more secure.

To set the complexity level of passwords allowed in your account, go to Builder > App settings > Password

### Password complexity

Password complexity is a measure of how difficult a password is to guess. The password complexity will appear when a user creates a password (sign-up page, activation page - if [email verification](/v2.0.0/docs/identity-protection) in enabled, Admin Portal)

1. **Easy** \- Minimum of 6 characters
2. **Medium** \- Minimum of 8 characters, and two out of the four tests (uppercase, lower case, number, special character), and avoid 3 recurring characters.
3. **Hard** \-Minimum of 8 characters, and four out of the four tests (uppercase, lower case, number, special character), and avoid 3 recurring characters.

In the following example, we used a Medium password complexity level. In the process of creating a password, tags appear and guide you to create a valid password

### Exposed credential detection

In case of a data breach on a site or app resulting in a password being exposed, you can choose between two actions

1. Allow using a breached password and send an email notification to the user
2. Don't allow using a breached password and show an error message

### Password repeat protection

Choose the number of new, unique passwords a user must create before using an old one

### Brute force protection

Choose the number of incorrect login attempts a user can make before they get locked out
