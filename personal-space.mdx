### Gain Ultimate Control with Frontegg's Admin Portal

Imagine your customers or users need to perform various tasks such as resetting their passwords, enabling Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), configuring Single Sign-On (SSO), or managing API tokens within your application. Each of these functions typically entails building and maintaining interfaces from scratchâ€”a resource-intensive endeavor.

But here's the good news: You don't have to take on this burden.

With Frontegg, you can seamlessly embed the Frontegg Admin Portal into your application. This empowers your customers and users to independently execute a wide range of Frontegg-related tasks. Even more convenient, you have the flexibility to select which features are accessible to your customers through the Frontegg Builder, ensuring a tailored and efficient user experience.What can your customers and users do in the Admin Portal? Glad you asked!

The Admin Portal is split into two parts: features that are for individual users, and features that are meant for accounts. Those are divided into the Admin Portal **Personal Space**, And Admin Portal **Workspace**.

### Personal Space Features

The Personal tab under your Admin Portal gives you control over the settings relating to your user's personal information, as well as their customers' information. In the Personal spaces users can: 

* Manage their user **profile** including editing details like their profile picture and name
* Set their personal **privacy & security** policies like implementing MFA on their account, seeing which devices they're currently logged in on, and change their password
* Create and manage **personal API tokens**
