title: "Breached Password"
---

Password breaches have become a prevalent threat to online security, and apps, including yours, must take proactive measures to safeguard their users' sensitive information. Ideally, you want all your users to have fresh, unique passwords that haven’t been hacked. This is difficult, but Frontegg makes it easy. This guide will tell you about Frontegg’s Breached Password detection and how to configure it.

### How it works

The breached password engine scans user passwords during the signups and login process and compares them to databases of known breached passwords. This is all done without exposing passwords. 

If a match is found, appropriate actions can be taken, such as requiring the user to reset their password or implementing additional security measures.

### Configuring Breached Password

> Good to know

> You only need to use breached password protection if you use [Passwords](/docs/passwords-1) as one of your authentication strategies.

All you need to do is choose what should happen when a breached password is detected: Allow, Challenge, or Block.

See the next section to learn more about how user experiences will be affected by each action.

### Your User's Experience

Frontegg checks if passwords are breached in two different flows: 

1. Password use - like during login
2. Password creation - like during signup or password changes

You can choose if users can use/create breached passwords or not. Just choose from one of the actions below:

| Action    | User experience on login                                                                                                                                         | User experience on password creation (signup or changing password)  |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Allow     | 1\. User continues to the app                                                                                                                                    | User is allowed to create a password that is breached (e.g. 123456) |
| Challenge | 1\. User must complete an MFA challenge2\. User continues to the app                                                                                             | User is not allowed to create a password that is breached           |
| Block     | 1\. User sees a screen that their password is breached with a mandate to change their password immediately2\. Users go to their email and click a reset password | User is not allowed to create a password that is breached           |
