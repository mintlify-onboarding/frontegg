### Step 1: Open Project

To create your OAuth application, go to [Microsoft Azure](https://portal.azure.com/#home) and select **Manage Azure Active Directory**.

> Choose the option **Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (e.g. Skype, Xbox)**

  
### Step 3: Get ClientId and Client Secret

Your Microsoft ClientId is located on your Microsoft app's Overview page. Look for Application (client) ID.

To create a client secret, open **Certificates & secrets** and click on **New client secret**.

### Customizing Authentication Scopes for Microsoft

Customizing Scopes for Microsoft Social Login

Scopes let you specify exactly what type of information your application can fetch from your users after they grant it access— and the generated access token includes these approved scopes. Frontegg currently fetches a _user profile_ and _user email_ as default scopes when users authenticate via their Microsoft account. You can add additional, custom scopes to your social login via your Frontegg portal. To do so, go to \[_Environment name_\] > Authentication > Social login > Custom > Scopes. You can check Microsoft's supported scopes [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/scopes-oidc).
