## Admin Portal Integration

Embed the admin portal into your application by following this guide.  
  
For Frontegg admin portal integration, we will import the `openAdminPortal` method from the `@frontegg/vue` package and use it when clicking on the relevant button.

  
App.vue

`<template>
  <div id="app" v-if="fronteggLoaded">
    <img alt="Vue logo" src="./assets/logo.png" />
    <p>
      Logged in as
      {{ this.authState.user ? this.authState.user.email : "Not logged in" }}
    </p>
    <button v-on:click="showAdminPortal">Open admin portal</button>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import { AdminPortal } from "@frontegg/vue";

export default {
  name: "App",
  components: {
    HelloWorld
  },
  data() {
    return {
      ...this.mapAuthState(),
    };
  },
  methods: {
    showAdminPortal() {
      AdminPortal.show();
    },
  },
};
</script>
`
