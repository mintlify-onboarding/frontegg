title: "Impossible Travel"
---

Impossible travel refers to a situation where a user's actions suggest that they have accessed a particular system or resource from two different geographic locations in an impossibly short amount of time.

For example, if a user logs into their email account from New York and then, within a span of just a few minutes, appears to log in from London, it would be considered impossible travel. This kind of activity often indicates a security breach or a compromised account, as it would be physically impossible for a person to travel between those two distant locations in such a short period.

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for detecting impossible travel.
